# Eneby jukebox

My 4-year old asked if he could play some music in his room....

That used to be the sign to buy a my-first-sony, walkman, discman, mp3-player or iPod. But these days everything is streaming or involves a phone or tablet.
Giving a phone or tablet to my children and configuring it to be child-safe sounded like a lot of work. Plus the music that comes from it is kinda crap.

So, there must be something we can hack together (quickly). We already had some playlists in place on Spotify, so playing those would be kinda nice. After some thinking and investigating: raspberry-pi (1st goto when you need some online device) combined with some rfid cards and a reader and a Eneby speaker.

The Eneby speaker actually came later in the plan, the first plan was to buy some cheap speakers and hack them into some container. But the sound is awful.
Then I came across the Eneby speaker from Ikea, costing just euro 50 and delivering quite a nice sound (for its price).
